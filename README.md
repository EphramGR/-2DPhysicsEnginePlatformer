# -2DPhysicsEnginePlatformer

Uses vectors and physics calculations to make the player (a cube) slide around and bounce of walls accordingly.
Incorporated normal force, gravitational force (split up on slants to x and y), and applied forces from user input.
Created a map making tool, that would allow easy map creation, and import the maps into the actual game.
